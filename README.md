# GuestStreams
 A discord bot to let channel guests view and start streams!
 
 GuestStreams is using the [Javacord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord) library.
 
# Why GuestStreams?
 Unfortunately Discord doesn't allow users to view and start streams if they don't have permission to view the channel.
 
 GuestStreams temporarily adds permissions to view and start streams while the user is inside a specific channel.
 
# Setup
 A tutorial can be found at the [Wiki](https://github.com/LEONARD0X/GuestStreams/wiki).
