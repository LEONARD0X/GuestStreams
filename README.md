# GuestStreams
 A discord bot to let channel guests view and start streams!
 
 To invite the bot to your server [click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=796352445268623382&scope=bot).
 
 GuestStreams is using the [Javacord](https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord) library.
 
 
# Why GuestStreams?
 Unfortunately Discord doesn't allow users to view and start streams if they don't have permission to view the channel.
 
 GuestStreams temporarily adds permissions to view and start streams while the user is inside a specific channel.
 
# Setup
 A tutorial can be found at the [Wiki](https://github.com/LEONARD0X/GuestStreams/wiki).
